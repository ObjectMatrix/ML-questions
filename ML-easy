1. Resampling the Dataset:

Oversampling the Minority Class: Increase the number of samples in the minority class by duplicating them or synthesizing new samples (e.g., using SMOTE - Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
Undersampling the Majority Class: Reduce the number of samples in the majority class. This can help balance the dataset but may lead to a loss of potentially valuable data.

Altering the Class Weights:
Adjust the weights in the classification algorithm to make it pay more attention to the minority class. Many algorithms have a parameter that allows you to set the class weights inversely proportional to their frequencies.

Using Appropriate Evaluation Metrics:
Avoid using accuracy as the sole metric since it can be misleading in unbalanced datasets. Prefer metrics like F1-score, precision, recall, ROC-AUC, or confusion matrices that give a better understanding of performance across classes.

Ensemble Methods:
Use ensemble learning techniques like bagging or boosting, which can be more effective for imbalanced datasets. Boosting algorithms like AdaBoost or Gradient Boosting can focus more on the minority class.

Anomaly Detection Techniques:
In cases where the minority class is very rare, treating the problem as an anomaly detection task can be effective. Algorithms like Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM might be appropriate.

Custom Loss Functions:
Designing a custom loss function that penalizes misclassifications of the minority class more than the majority class can help in focusing the learning more on the minority class.

Data Segmentation:
Sometimes, segmenting the data into more homogenous groups and building separate models for each segment can help in handling imbalance more effectively.

Using Advanced Algorithms:
Some algorithms are better suited for imbalanced datasets. For example, tree-based algorithms like Random Forests and certain neural network configurations might handle imbalances better.

Cross-validation Strategy:
Use stratified K-fold cross-validation that maintains the same ratio of classes in every fold to ensure that the model gets exposed to enough examples of each class during training.

Early Stopping and Regularization:
Implement early stopping to prevent overfitting on the majority class. Regularization techniques can also help in this regard.

Accuracy, Precision
Accuracy= True Positives + True Negatives / Total Observations
â€‹Precision = True Positives / True Positive + False Positive
